				<h5>What is Siminars?</h5>
				<p >Siminars is an intuitive, online publishing platform that provides you with all the tools you need to create highy interactive courses and distribute/sell them to your audience.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>How does Siminars help me monitize my courses?</h5>
				<p>We have in-platform credit card and paypal payment systems so you don't have to worry about the collection part. We tie-ups with ClickBank and HasOffers to help you set up an affiliate network of marketers and resellers to sell your content.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5>Does Siminar allow all these features in the Open (free) Plan?</h5>
				<p>We wish! But we have infrastructure costs and salaries to pay and hence must charge for our services (but it still is the lowest in the market)! You can try out our platform for free with our Opan Plan and even publish a course, but you wont be able to charge for the course. You can always upgrade to our <a href="http://about.siminars.com/#retailplans" target="_blank">Retail Plans</a> or <a href="http://about.siminars.com/private.html" target="_blank"> Private Plans</a> once you're ready to monitize!
